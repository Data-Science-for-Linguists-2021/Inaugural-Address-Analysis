## 3. Data cleanup
... and here I am, pointing to a [particular section of my code](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Inaugural-Address-Project/blob/master/process_data.ipynb#Second-section) in my Jupyter Notebook. Note that I am linking to the jupyter nbviewer's rendered view. (Linking to the GitHub's version will be [like this](process_data.ipynb#Second-section), only that it does not work. More info in the [guildelines](https://naraehan.github.io/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/project#final).)   

## 4. Analysis
... Again, make sure to link to [relevant sections of your code](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Inaugural-Address-Project/blob/master/process_data.ipynb#Third-section). Plots can be embedded too, like below. Click the `Raw` button above to see my Markdown source code.
